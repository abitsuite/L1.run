## NodΞRunr v24.12.xx — Windows Support {{ date: '2025-01-31T00:00Z' }}

In the latest release, I've added support for "native" Windows.

```ts
powershell -c "irm L1.run/install.ps1|iex"
```

It's also been a pretty helpful way to remind myself what the hell I was working on at the end of the day yesterday when I get back to my computer and realize I didn't commit any of my work.

### <SparkleIcon /> What's Coming Soon?

- Enable support for Windows 10+

![NodeRunr 1st Release](@/images/banners/first-release.png)

## NodΞRunr v24.12.1 — 1st Release {{  date: '2024-12-01T00:00Z' }}

NodΞRunr is a lightweight, smart daemon delivering effortless SysOps to Avalanche Founders and Teams —
assure your community of a SAFU space by maintaining your AVAX Layer-1 nodes from anywhere, at any time.

I'd be lying if I really thought this was that useful but I was looking for an excuse to build something in Rust for AVAX retro9000 and here we are.
It's Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) at least, so maybe you can find something interesting [__in the code__](https://github.com/nyusternie/layer1run).
