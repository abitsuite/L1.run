## NodΞRunr v24.12.1 — 1st Release {{  date: '2024-12-01T00:00Z' }}

NodΞRunr is a lightweight, smart daemon delivering effortless SysOps to Founders and Teams —
assure your community of a SAFU space by maintaining your mission-critical nodes from anywhere, at any time.

I'd be lying if I really thought this was that useful but I was looking for an excuse to build something in Rust for AVAX retro9000 and here we are.
It's Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) at least, so maybe you can find something interesting [__in the code__](https://github.com/nyusternie/layer1run).
