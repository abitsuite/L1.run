## NodΞRunr v25.1.xx — Mainnet (Etna) Release {{ date: '2025-01-01T00:00Z' }}

I've added support for creating per-project `.commitrc` files that override your global settings for that particular project. Went with YAML for these because personally I'm sick of quoting keys in JSON all the time, or accidentally leaving in a trailing comma.

### <SparkleIcon /> What's Coming Soon?

- Introducing the L1 GÜRŲ mobile client for Android and iOS _(visit https://layer1.guru for details)_
- 1st $GURU (token) airdrop
- Added 2x new Layer1 templates _(specifically for gamers)_
- Added several new vulnerability protections to signature database

It's also been a pretty helpful way to remind myself what the hell I was working on at the end of the day yesterday when I get back to my computer and realize I didn't commit any of my work.

- Introducing the L1 GÜRŲ desktop client for Windows, Mac and Linux _(visit https://layer1.guru for details)_

It's also been a pretty helpful way to remind myself what the hell I was working on at the end of the day yesterday when I get back to my computer and realize I didn't commit any of my work.

### <SparkleIcon /> What's Coming Soon?

- Added commit message and description suggestions powered by OpenAI

## NodΞRunr v24.12.5 — 1-Click Blockchain Setup & Installation {{ date: '2024-12-05T00:00Z' }}

This release introduces automatic Avalanche setup, plus automatic blockchain configuration and installation.

I released this thing last week hoping a couple of people would say "awesome job" and make me feel good about what I'd built but instead I just got a ton of people shaming me on X for being such a horrible person for only shipping a light UI.

### <SparkleIcon /> New & Noteworthy Improvements

- Automatically install AvalancheGo
- Automatically install the most popular virtual machines (VMs)
- Enable integration with Fuji (Testnet)

## NodΞRunr v24.12.1 — 1st Release {{  date: '2024-12-01T00:00Z' }}

NodΞRunr is a lightweight daemon you can pull up from anywhere with a keyboard shortcut that makes it really easy to commit your work.

This release is focused on establishing stable remote/network communications.

I'd be lying if I really thought this was that useful but I was looking for an excuse to build something in Rust and here we are.
It's open source at least so maybe you can find something interesting in the code even if the app itself is a total waste of hard drive space.
